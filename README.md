__Note__: This link may not work later (after 24 July 2019). I will try and post the updated link (later).


# installation (tested on windows 10) 

1. Install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) for python 3
2. Open anaconda prompt and create a new environment with packages (gdal & geopandas). 

```python
conda create -n geo_env gdal geopandas
```

This should hopefully (also) install 

  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - pandas
  - shapely

3. Download the repo, unzip and keep on desktop

**points 1, 2 and 3 are one time process. need not be repeated once done.**

4. To run the notebooks, in anaconda prompt, navigate to your desktop folder (cd C:/Users/__username__/Desktop/ogr-geopandas/), and type "jupyter notebook" (without the quotes).
5. A browser should open with the notebooks listed. click on each to run them.
